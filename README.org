* Nimacs
  Nim integration for GNU Emacs.
  
  Purpose of this project is to allow extending GNU Emacs with Nim as an
  alternative to elisp.
  
  For module to work with GNU Emacs, you must accept GPL compatible license by
  passing flag =-d:acceptGPL= when compiling emacs module. Otherwise, emacs will
  refuse to load the module.
  
* Prerequisites
  By default GNU Emacs dynamic module support might be disabled. In order to
  enable this feature, Emacs has to be compiled from source using
  =--with-modules= flag when configuring it.
